Ensemble-PyTorch implements a collection of ensemble methods using PyTorch. It provides:

* Easy ways to boost the performance of your deep learning models;
* Easy-to-use APIs on training and evaluating;
* High training efficiency.

To get started, please refer to `Quick Start <./quick_start.html>`__. To learn more about ensemble methods currently supported, please refer to `Introduction <./introduction.html>`__.

This package is under active development. Please feel free to open an `issue <https://github.com/AaronX121/Ensemble-Pytorch/issues>`__ if your have any problem. In addition, any feature request or `pull request <https://github.com/AaronX121/Ensemble-Pytorch/pulls>`__ would be highly welcomed.
