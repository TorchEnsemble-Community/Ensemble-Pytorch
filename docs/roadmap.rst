* |Efficiency| Improve the training and evaluating efficiency of existing ensembles

New Functionality
-----------------

* |MajorFeature| |API| Add the partial-fit mode for all ensembles
* |MajorFeature| |API| Support manually-specified evaluation metrics when calling :meth:`predict`
* |MajorFeature| |API| Integration with :mod:`torch.utils.tensorboard` for better visualization
* |MajorFeature| |API| Support arbitrary training criteria for existing ensembles

Maintenance Related
-------------------
